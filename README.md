# DeadTreeCore
This repo is going to tell you how to use D3 force layout to construct knowledge map!     
Just clone it and then run in VS2017 with localDB!

## How To Use
* <b>Registered Account:</b> Only registered expert account    
* <b>Fusion Algorithm:</b> The current knowledge map fusion algorithm uses the exact same fusion method      
* <b>Usage Note:</b> Since the construction of the knowledge map uses the force-oriented diagram CDN provided by D3.JS, it is necessary to use the system when connecting to the network.    
* <b>Necessary environment:</b> MS.NET CORE 2.0 running browsers supporting Chrome 53+ (must support advanced JS methods)
